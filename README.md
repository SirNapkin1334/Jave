# Jave
Any time I want to mess around with something Java-related, I do it here. Some examples include compiling chunks of code and then viewing it with `javap` in order to assist in inserting code with ASM, and messing around with the JVM in general. For example, `Void`, `Void_`, and `Void3` were all part of my endeavor to create and invoke methods with parameters of type `void`. `Int.java` and `Int.class` were me messing around with interpreting stack data as different types, i.e. converting `long` to `float` by reinterpreting the bits. It is completely disorganized, and mostly just done because I can. Have a nice day.
